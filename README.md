# React JS 

## Best Practices for React JS
- 1. When naming a component start with Capital letter 
- 2. File names too should be Capital letter
- 3. Few libraries forces you to end file with `.jsx`
- 4. If the file is returning a component then end it with `.jsx` and if it contains javascript functionality then end it with `.js`
