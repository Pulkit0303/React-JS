# React JS 

#### Best Practices for React JS
- When naming a component start with Capital letter 
- File names too should be Capital letter
- Few libraries forces you to end file with `.jsx`
- If the file is returning a component then end it with `.jsx` and if it contains javascript functionality then end it with `.js`
